# Cricket_score_predictor

I used google colab to create a machine learning model that will predict what score the world cup team would make.

The features used for this model are:-
  1. batting and bowling team
  2. city
  3. current score
  4. overs left
  5. runs made in last 5 overs

The model uses scikit-learn and random forest classifier
